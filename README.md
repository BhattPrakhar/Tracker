# Tracker
 Basic Live Number Tracking
# 📍 Phone Number Location Tracker (Simulated Live Tracking)

This Python project lets you:
- 📞 Get the **country and service provider** of a phone number
- 🗺️ Show the **approximate location** of the number on a map
- 🚗 Simulate **live tracking** by updating the map every few seconds

> ⚠️ This is a **simulation only**. It does not track real-time GPS — just demonstrates how tracking might work.
